The Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning project is aimed at developing a deep 
learning based system that can accurately detect brain tumors from medical images such as 
MRI scans. The proposed system will use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze 
the medical images and output the probability of the presence of a tumor, along with its 
location, size, and type. The traditional methods of detecting brain tumors involve human 
interpretation of medical images, which can be time-consuming and subjective. The proposed 
system aims to automate this process, reducing the burden on radiologists and improving the 
accuracy and speed of detection.
